# My-Pi-Page

Raspberry Pi topics that interest me.

## Inspiration

Jeff Geerling (@geerlingguy) has done so much for the Raspberry Pi community, but has not covered some of the things that interest me. I've done some of my own investigations and keep notes on that and perhaps some of that would be of general interest.

## Format

All topics will have a heading here. Some that require more content will have their own detail page as well. At some point I plan to integrate this with [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

## Debian on a Pi 4

I run Debian [tailored for the Pi](https://raspi.debian.net/) on some Pi 4Bs. I have a 4B/8GB that I run as a desktop and usually run Debian Bullseye on it. Some things I learned to make this work.

* Disable suspend. It will suspend and I cannot figure out how to get it to resume.

## Powered USB hubs

Necessary for SSDs on the Pi 4B. Tests here](Powered-Hub.md).

## Contributing

Feel free to submit a PR or otherwise point out typos. mispelings [sic] or ask for clarification for anything that doesn't seem clear, is ambiguous or otherwise needs improvement. I understand it but I wrote it. (Or it was hard for me to write so it should be hard to understand.)
